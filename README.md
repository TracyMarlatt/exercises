A software engineering exercise for SIOS job applicants

## Problem
The code in this repository is quite simple: for an array of shapes, it calculates the total area of those shapes. The code works correctly for both circles and rectangles. However, there is a big problem: if we create any new class of shapes, we will have to modify the AreaCalculator class.

By modifying, creating, or deleting Java files as appropriate, update the solution so that the AreaCalculator class can calculate the total area of an array of shapes without any code change to the AreaCalculator class. For example, if Alice were to download the source code, Alice should be able to create a Triangle class, create an array of shapes that includes an instance of the triangle class, pass in this array to the calculateArea method, and the method should correctly calculate the total area of the shape array. **Alice should not have to modify the AreaCalculator class for it to calculate the correct answer.**
